Kilosort is best used in conjunction with Phy. The .npy and .csv output files can then be loaded back into Matlab, following these general instructions: https://github.com/kwikteam/phy-contrib/blob/master/docs/template-gui.md. For a full example, see the tutorial with Neuropixels results data available here: http://data.cortexlab.net/singlePhase3/ and here: http://data.cortexlab.net/dualPhase3/.

However, in some situations you might need to use the Matlab results structures. Here is an explanation of these variables, available inside the struct called "rez".

New in Kilosort2:

- **ccb**: dissimilarity matrix between each batch and every other batch

- **ccbsort**: ccb reordered by the drift estimation algorithm

Both Kilosort1 and Kilosort2:

- **xc, yc**: x and y coordinates of each channel on the probe, in the order of channels provided in the channel map (default is linear, 1:1:nChannels).

- **connected**: whether a channel in the original binary dat is "connected", or "active". Inactive channels are ignored.

- **Wrot**: cross-channel whitening matrix. Wrot * high_pass_filtered_data = post_data, where post_data is the postprocessed data on which the Kilosort algorithm is applied.

- **WrotInv**: is the matrix inverse of Wrot. WrotInv * post_data = high_pass_filtered_data

- **ops**: keeps all the configuration settings provided by the user, and cumulative information added throghout the Kilosort steps

- **st**: first column is the spike time in samples, second column is the spike template, third column is the extracted amplitude, and fifth column is the post auto-merge cluster (if you run the auto-merger).

- **mu**: mean amplitude for each template

- **U**: low-rank components of the spatial masks for each template

- **W**: low-rank components of the temporal masks for each template

- **dWU**: average of a subset of spikes corresponding to each template. The low-rank decomposition of this matrix results in W and U.

- **Wraw**: the spike template, un-whitened by the operation Wraw(:,:,n) = Wrotinv' * (U(:,n,:) * W(:,n,:)'), for each template n.

- **simScore**: correlation between all pairs of templates.

- **cProj**: projections of each detected spike onto the principal components of the channels corresponding to the spike's assigned template. The channel order for each template is available in iNeigh.

- **iNeigh**: for each template, the channels with largest amplitudes are indexed in order (default 12). This indexing is used to sort coefficients in cProj. Notice this is a fundamentally sparse scheme: only the top channels for each template are stored.

- **cProjPC**: projections of each detected spike onto the top templates most similar to the spike's assigned template. The nearest-template order for each template is available in iNeighPC.

- **iNeighPC**: for each template, the other templates with largest similarity are indexed in order (default 12). This indexing is used to sort coefficients in cProjPC. Notice this is a fundamentally sparse scheme: only the top closest template for each template are stored.
